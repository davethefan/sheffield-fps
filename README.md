# sheffield-fps
Sheffield first-person-shooter based on a Sheffield street map. 

You'll need git LFS for this, because the .blend file is above 50mb, and will continue to grow.


Based on mesh generated by blender-osm (https://github.com/vvoovv/blender-osm) of Sheffield City Center.
Currently, the buildings are being UV mapped to look like their real world counterparts
